        <h3>Culture</h3>
        <p>
          Througout its long history, Japan imported customs and products
          from foreign countries such as China, and perfected into Japanese ways.
          On the other hands, Japan has been developed its original tradition
          and culture such as tea ceremony, ikebana (flower arrangement), Kabuki and so forth.
          Living in harmony with nature,
          Japanese people developed their original ways of life, manners and customs.

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h3>Religion</h3>
        <p>
          Most Japanese do not exclusively identify themselves as adherents of a single religion; rather,
          they incorporate elements of various religions
          in a syncretic fashion known as Shinbutsu shugo (amalgamation of kami and buddhas).
          Shinbutsu Shugo officially ended with the Shinto and Buddhism Separation Order of 1886,
          but continues in practice.
          Shinto and Japanese Buddhism are therefore best understood not as two completely separate
          and competing faiths, but rather as a single, rather complex religious system.

        <p>
          Japanese cuisine is the food擁ngredients, preparation and way of eating熔f Japan.
          The traditional food of Japan is based on rice with miso soup and other dishes,
          each in its own utensil, with an emphasis on seasonal ingredients.
          The side dishes often consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth.
          Fish is common in the traditional cuisine.
          It is often grilled, but it may also be served raw as sashimi or in sushi.
          Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light batter as tempura.
          "Washoku" Japanese cuisine was designated as world intangible cultural heritage of UNESCO in December, 2014.
