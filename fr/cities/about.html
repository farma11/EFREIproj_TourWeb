        <h3>Religion</h3>
        <p>
          France is a secular country, and freedom of religion is a constitutional right.
          French religious policy is based on the concept of laïcité,
          a strict separation of church and state under which public life is kept completely secular.
          <br>
          Catholicism has been the predominant religion in France for more than a millennium,
          though it is not as actively practised today as it was.
          Among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% are Roman Catholic.
